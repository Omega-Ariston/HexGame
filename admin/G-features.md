Our project implements the following features: _(delete those not complete)_

### Part One

**Pass**
* Successfully implement `HexGame.legitimateBaffles()`.
* Successfully implement `HexGame.legitimageNooks()`.

**Distinction**
* Successfully implement `HexGame.legitimateGame()`.
* Successfully implement `HexGame.legitimateStep()`.

### Part Two

**Pass**
* Appropriate use of git (as demonstrated by the history of your repo).
* A working implementation of a basic _single-piece, single-player_ hex game implemented in JavaFX.
* Executable on a standard lab computer from a runnable jar file, game.jar, which resides in the root level of your group repo.
* Correctly implements `HexGame.toString()` that produces an encoding of the game represented by a `HexGame` object.
* Generates a correct  game state when a `HexGame` object is created using the constructor that takes a game description.

**Credit**
* The game a correct random game state when a `HexGame` object is created using its default constructor.
* The game indicates a solvable objective to the user at the start of a round, and allows the user to input their solution via the mouse.
* The game checks that users' solution is correct.

**Distinction**
* The game provides a timer, limiting how long each round takes.
* The game supports multiple players.
* The game implements a scoring system.
* The game identifies an optimal solution if the player's solution was not optimal.

**High Distinction**
* The game supports multiple pieces.
* The game identifies the correctness of multi-piece moves.
* The game identifies optimal multi-piece moves.
* The game has a sense of level of difficulty, selecting moves accordingly (perhaps difficulty increases as the game progresses, or players can choose difficulty level; the details are left to you).
